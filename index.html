        <h3 class="infoHead">Research</h3>
        <p>Our research consisted of a combination of methods, including face to face interviews and a smaller sample sized version of the questions, sent out in an online survey, we focused on the following objectives.</p>
         <li>To learn how housemates delegate household chores between one another</li>
  <li> To understand how housemates organise the splitting and payment of bills</li>
  <li>To find out how housemates keep updated with all social events and urgent household issues.</li>
</p>
<p>Over the course of the two days we conducted six 1 on 1 interviews with users who are currently living in share-house accommodation or have done in the past 12 months. 

  A smaller sample of questions was sent via a facebook survey to participants who met the criteria, these two methods  allowed us to collect both quantitative and qualitative data to identify the common pain points/themes that users have brought up and try to find possible solutions.

        <p>During our user interviews and online survey, we discovered that people living in share houses like to live in a clean house but don't like to take initiative and the responsibility of delegating tasks. There was a negative perception of the role "House Mum", refering that "telling people what to do, can lead to creating resentment and tension within the house". 
          This was interesting, as most people had mentioned that the most frustating and annoying part of house sharing is when house mate's don't help with cleaning up or a messy individuals. This was a large part of repsondenants negative house sharing experiences, as users did not want to bring it up out of fear it would create conflict amongst housemates.</p>

          <div class="container-fluid content">
          <h3 class="infoHead">Ideation</h3>
          <p>With the research wrapped up, the team got together to anaylyze and start to deconstruct the data collected. The affinity diagram allowed us to notice patterns and themes amongst the user insights. Using this method was vital in helping us discover the users needs and pain points, whilst offering possible solution options to think about.</p>
             <div class="jumbotron affinityMap"></div>

          <div class="container-fluid content">
            <p>The image is a sample size of the full affinity diagram to display the topics created from our user insights. The topics are based on the 5 recurring themes we discovered, which are important to our users' experience in relation to share housing. The 5 factor are:
               <p>- Cost: Share housing is attractive as it means expensives are shared so it is a great way to save money  </p>
               <p>- Responsibility: Taking initiave and being on top of household tasks</p> 
               <p>- Cleaning: How often do you clean and how do you feel about a cleaning roster?</p> 
               <p>- Interpesonal: Communication between housemates, how do they keep up to date with house hold matters? </p> 
               <p>- Community: the overall enviroment and dynamic between housemates. Is it friendly or is there tension around? </p></p>
            <div>
              <p>After synthesizing our data, we discovered people felt that living in a clean house and sharing the responsibilities of household tasks, created a more harmonious community environment, which was the goal for people who live in a share house. With this goal in mind we were able to define the problem we were designing a solution for:HouseMate is designed to create a harmonious community environment within a share-house. By simplifying delegation of tasks to avoid interpersonal conflict amongst housemates, allowing our users to co-exist in share-house living and create better relationships amongst 	
              all housemates.              
             <h5>The Problem</h5>
             <p>We believe equal distribution of household responsibilities and creating accountability for housemates within share houses will achieve a harmonious community environment for all.</p>

          <p> Create the option to name the house during the onboarding process.

         <p>Overall though the team is very happy with the result of the project and feel we have designed an app that can add real value to its users lives. Currently with share housing being popular we believe there is a large market to capitalize on and hopefully it will allow us to assist our users in achieving their end goal of creating a harmonious community environment within their share house. </p></div>
